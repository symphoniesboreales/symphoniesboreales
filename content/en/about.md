# The project’s origin

Boreal Symphonies is a project that fuses arts and scientific outreach, based on the musical transcription of the annual growth of the trees that compose dozens of old-growth forests in Quebec. The project originates from Maxence Martin's research in forest ecology about the diversity, dynamics, and conservation of old-growth boreal forests in Eastern Canada. This project was carried out by using his research data, with the objective of scientific communication. The project's original goal was to lead the general public towards a better understanding and awareness on the subject of old-growth boreal forests. To do so, Maxence Martin surrounded himself with an interdisciplinary team with the purpose to create a singular interdisciplinary work, associating science with multiple artistic fields.
