# The project

Boreal Symphonies is a project that fuses arts and scientific outreach, based on the musical transcription of the annual growth of the trees that compose dozens of old-growth forests in Quebec. The project originates from Maxence Martin's doctoral thesis in ecology at the Université du Québec à Chicoutimi (UQAC) about the diversity, dynamics and conservation of old-growth boreal forests in Eastern Canada. This project was thus carried out using his research data but in parallel with this doctoral work, with the objective of scientific communication. he project's original goal was to bring the general public to a better understanding and awareness of the subject of old-growth boreal forests. To do so, Maxence Martin has surrounded himself with several students or former students of UQAC, in order to create a singular interdisciplinary work, associating science with multiple artistic fields. The members of the team are presented
