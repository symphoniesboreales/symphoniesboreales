# The research project at the origin of Boreal Symphonies

The resulting symphonies for " Boreal Symphonies " were created from scientific research data obtained as part of Maxence Martin's doctoral project, named " Typology, dynamics and conservation value of old boreal forests in managed territory ". As its name implies, the objective of this thesis is to better understand the diversity and dynamics of old boreal forests. For more information on this project, click here.

This Ph.D was carried out under the NSERC Industrial Research Chair on Black Spruce Growth and the Influence of the Spruce Budworm on Landscape Variability in the Boreal Zone, under the supervision of Hubert Morin and Nicole J. Fenton [lien](http://www.uqac.ca/chairtbe/ "Chaire de recherche industrielle CRSNG sur la croissance de l’épinette noire et l’influence de la tordeuse des bourgeons de l’épinette sur la variabilité des paysages en zone boréale"), sous la direction de Hubert Morin et Nicole J. Fenton.

Headings of some of the scientific papers produced from Boreal Symphony forest data
If "Boreal Symphonies" is the artistic counterpart of this doctoral project, the scientific aspect has not been neglected. Numerous scientific articles analyzing the forests of the Boreal Symphonies have already been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. A list of these articles can be found here (link: https://www.researchgate.net/project/Typology-dynamics-and-conservation-value-of-boreal-old-growth-forests-in-managed-landscapes).
If you are interested in reading some of these articles and if they are not freely available, don't panic! You can contact the authors directly by email to ask them. They will gladly send them to you!
