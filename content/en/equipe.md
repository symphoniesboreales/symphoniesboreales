Maxence Martin is the instigator of this project and the composer of the Boreal Symphonies. He completed his Ph.D in forest ecology at the l’Université du Québec à Chicoutimi,  Québec , Canada, between 2014 and 2019, his thesis topic being the diversity, dynamics, and conservation of old-growth boreal forests in managed areas.
It was during this work that he came up with the idea of using his research data to create a scientific mediation project to educate and raise public awareness about boreal old-growth forests.
He is currently a postdoctoral fellow at the l’Université du Québec à Chicoutimi and continues to lead the Boreal Symphonies project.

Valentina Buttò is a doctoral student in environmental sciences at the l’Université du Québec à Chicoutimi . Her studies focus on the modeling of black spruce growth, whose variations are studied according to factors endogenous to the trees and environmental factors. When she's not looking at these wood cells under a microscope or looking for mathematical relationships, Valentina is the watercolorist for Boreal Symphonies. She has been making the small trees that grow around the melodies since the beginning of the project.



# Alexa Tremblay-Francoeur
