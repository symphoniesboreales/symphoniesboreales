Maxence Martin is the instigator of this project and the composer of the Boreal Symphonies. He completed his Ph.D in forest ecology at the l’Université du Québec à Chicoutimi, Québec , Canada, between 2014 and 2019, his thesis topic being the diversity, dynamics, and conservation of old-growth boreal forests in managed areas. It was during this work that he came up with the idea of using his research data to create a scientific mediation project to educate and raise public awareness about boreal old-growth forests. He is currently a postdoctoral fellow at the l’Université du Québec à Chicoutimi as well as the Université du Québec en Abitibi-Témiscamingue, and continues to lead the Boreal Symphonies project.

Valentina Buttò is  PhD in environmenta science and postdoctoral researcher at the  Université du Québec à Chicoutimi and the Université du Québec en Outaouais. Her studies focus on the modeling of black spruce growth, whose variations are studied according to factors endogenous to the trees and environmental factors. When she's not looking at these wood cells under a microscope or looking for mathematical relationships within her data, Valentina is the watercolorist for Boreal Symphonies. She has been making the  little trees that grow around the melodies ever since the beginning of the project.

She then specializes in visual arts and traditional animation, where she mainly explores the medium of short film. Her work has been presented at various Canadian and international short film festivals since 2017. She supports the Boreal Symphonies project mainly for the artistic aspect of the project (graphics, installations, projections), but also to communicate the importance of outreaching science to the g public in order to bring better understanding and re-appropriation of its  territory.
