# The research project at the origin of Boreal Symphonies

This Ph.D was carried out under the NSERC Industrial Research Chair on Black Spruce Growth and the Influence of the Spruce Budworm on Landscape Variability in the Boreal Zone, under the supervision of Hubert Morin and Nicole J. Fenton.

If "Boreal Symphonies" is the artistic counterpart of this doctoral project, the scientific aspect has not been neglected. Numerous scientific articles analyzing the forests of the Boreal Symphonies have already been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. A list of these articles can be found here (link: https://www.researchgate.net/project/Typology-dynamics-and-conservation-value-of-boreal-old-growth-forests-in-managed-landscapes).
If you are interested in reading some of these articles and if they are not freely available, don't panic! You can contact the authors directly by email to ask them. They will gladly send them to you!
