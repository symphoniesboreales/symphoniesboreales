# The traveling exhibition

In order to highlight the resulting symphonies and explain what they mean, we have created a traveling exhibition in the form of an immersive journey where spectators can immerse themselves in the world of the Boreal Symphonies.

This exhibition then symbolizes the union between arts and sciences, where the symphonies are accompanied by visual works and didactic texts allowing us to understand the history of these old-growth forests.

The form of this exhibition has changed greatly over time. It is now structured around an immersive habitat with a circumference of 5.5m/18' accompanied by audio terminals, explanatory panels, watercolors, and even projections. It aims to be displayed in places of art exhibitions, museums or any other environment aspiring to disseminate scientific knowledge and art to the general public.

# Orchestral adaptation of the Boreal Symphonies

Who, if not a symphony orchestra, could best showcase the Boreal Symphonies? 

This crazy idea led to the collaboration between Boreal Symphonies, the Symphony Orchestra of Saguenay Lac Saint-Jean, and Yannick Plamondon and Benoît Fortier from the Quebec City Conservatory.

A first Symphonie boréale was readapted by Yannick Plamondon and Benoît Fortier. This piece was scheduled to be performed for the first time by the Symphony Orchestra of Saguenay Lac Saint-Jean on March 21, 2020, but this event has since been postponed to an unknown date due to the COVID pandemic.




# The Symphonies of the Valley of Ghosts

The Valley of Ghosts is a forest well known to hikers in the Saguenay. The particular climatic conditions of this forest mean that during the winter, the trees most often find themselves dressed in a thick blanket of snow, forming thousands of "ghosts".

Moreover, the forest of the Valley of Ghosts also happens to be an old-growth forest that would not have burned for millennia! In order to highlight this exceptional natural heritage and to help hikers better understand the dynamics of this forest, we are currently working with Sépaq to create the "Symphonies of the Valley of Ghosts". Our ultimate goal is to create an educational trail allowing hikers to discover the symphonies obtained in the heart of this old forest.


# Educational kit

Introducing school audiences to boreal forests and forest ecology is one is among the main goals of Boreal Symphonies. Therefore, we are working on an educational kit for school boards to make them discover the Boreal Symphonies in a fun way. 

For an even more complete experience, this educational kit could be combined with the traveling exhibition and the Symphonies of the Valley of Ghosts, allowing students to move from theory to real-life experience in a real old-growth forest!


#  Towards new symphonies?

If Symphonies Boreales originated from research data obtained from old-growth forests in the Saguenay Lac Saint-Jean region of Quebec, it would be possible to create new symphonies using annual growth data from any forest.

We are currently working on enriching our compositions in order to offer symphonies that go all the way around the boreal forest and, why not, venture even beyond it!
